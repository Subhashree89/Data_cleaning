# Data_cleaning
A csv file/data set is given as "loan" we will analyze the data set using python, this process is called EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
We will be using the data dictionary to filter out the unnecessary columns and use built-in python methods to clean and explore the data.

The dataset was too big so I have put it in a zip file and added it to the repository.
